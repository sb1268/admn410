	<h1><b>About Us</b></h1>
	<p> DHP was founded in 2015 by Mary Summers. She was motivated to start DHP by her passion for animals of all species
	and her personal struggles to find all the products she needed for them in convenient locations. She started off selling basic 
	supplies for dogs, cats, and fish but over time learned the demand for more items for these animals. Now DHP provides great quality apparel, food, toys, 
	and more at great prices!</p>
